Create a new Database:
   sqlite3 mynewdatabase.db
   Add columns/primary key?
   This is taking much longer than expected

SQL Injection:
INSERT INTO scores ("winner_name", "player", "score") VALUES ('Rich Pearson', 'Player 1', 10);

DB is now set-up, need to add the AJAX on the condition of the win.

Now I need to 'Flask' All this!

Had a few issues with getting the JS and Audio files to work in Flask. Turns out I needed to do the following:
1. Move the js, css. static files/folders into a folder called static.
2. Then add this to app.py:

app = Flask(__name__, '/static')

3. In the index.html, amend all the scr links to the following:

JS:
<script src="../static/stars.js"></script>

Audio:
Audio('/static/audio/title.mp3');

And now we're working as before

Next, add the AJAX

This was a great read; https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pass-javascript-variables-to-python-in-flask/

Ok, done a whole load more now. Added a DB, added all sorts of things like player names etc. ALl very good stuff.

Just need to tidy up and debug I think, and I think it's good to go.

Also need to sort the bugs!!
